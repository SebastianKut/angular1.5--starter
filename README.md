# Angular 1.x styleguide (ES2015) Sample App

This sample app follows Architecture, file structure, components, one-way dataflow and best practices suggested by [@toddmotto](//twitter.com/toddmotto) on this repo [angular-styleguide](//github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide)

The app is really really simple, it is supposed to be a starting point to building an Angular 1.x app using es2015.

It is also a good companion to reading the Style Guide.

## Install
